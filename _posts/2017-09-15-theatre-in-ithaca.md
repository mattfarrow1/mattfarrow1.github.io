My alma mater’s paper, [The Ithacan](https://theithacan.org), posted an editorial earlier this week entitled _“Local theater initiatives deserve more recognition.”_ I know I’ve taken a [long, winding path ](http://mattfarrow.org/2017/04/19/my-research-journey/)to my current career, but a I am amazed by how strong my feelings are for my time in the theatre. Even today, seven years after I left IC as the Technical Supervisor, I still have dreams about [Dillingham](https://www.ithaca.edu/hs/depts/theatre/) and putting on shows in the Hoerner and Clark Theatres. 

From a work/life balance, I couldn't be happier with my current job, but there is still a surprisingly large part of me that misses that life.
