Today is our 11th anniversay, and I thought I'd celebrate my amazing wife by sharing her newest undertaking. [^1]

A couple of weeks ago, Harmonie asked me what I thought about her starting a blog. At the time, she’d been posting to Instagram about being a working mom, but I didn’t know she had an interest in blogging. I said I thought it was a great idea, and before I knew it, she’d built a [site](https://workingmom.life) and put up her [first post](https://workingmom.life/2018/03/05/why-am-i-here/), sharing her motivations for writing.

> This blog is for them and for every other working mom out there who desperately wishes there were 30 hours in a day to spend enough time with God and her family while tackling two never-ending to-do lists. 

I've always know that Harmonie wanted to have both a career and a family. What I am in constant awe of is her ability to juggle her family, career, speaking engagements, committees, bible study groups, and so much more in a way that seems almost effortless. 

So, on this anniversay, I give thanks to God for my amazing wife. I couldn't ask for a better friend, mother, and partner in life.
