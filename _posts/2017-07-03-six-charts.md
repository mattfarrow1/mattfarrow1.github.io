Quartz shared an analysis by [Henrik Lindberg](https://mobile.twitter.com/hnrklndbrg/status/872555621807267840) of data from the American Time Use Survey. Henrik wrote [several pieces](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/five-ways-to-spend-a-thursday-34432f9ee93e) and has shared his code over on [Github](https://gist.github.com/halhen/d969234077c9b70df4c4b8dd902bea38).
