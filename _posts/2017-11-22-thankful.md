The past couple of months have been incredibly busy, both personally as well as professionally. Things finally started to quiet down this past weekend with the completion of Apra North Texas' 2017 Conference.

As things quiet down this week, I thought I'd take some time to get back to the blog and share a few of the things I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving.

#### My Wife

First and foremost, I'm thankful for my wonderful wife. She is more patient and generous with me than I deserve and I can't imagine a better partner in life.

#### Our Kids

For our oldest, I'm thankful for her kindness and generosity. She is wise beyond her years and makes me want to be a better father.

For our youngest, I'm thankful for his boundless spirit. Exhausting as he may sometimes be, he's a loving, joyful kid who wants to do everything and make everyone laugh.

#### Our Family

This past year has been [hard](http://mattfarrow.org/2017/07/28/not-the-same/), but I'm so thankful for our amazing family on both sides. 

#### Our Church

We joined our church at the beginning of 2016 and since that time we've gone through an 11-week discipleship experience called [Rooted](http://mycompasschurch.com/default.aspx?page=4287) and have become close friends with some amazing people.

#### Our Community

As our kids have gotten older, I'm so thankful for the family-friendly neighborhood we live in. I'm also incredibly thankful for our amazing school district and the teachers who inspire our kids.

#### Our Home

We've now lived in our house for seven years and I can't imagine living anywhere else. As I look around, it is easy to pick out home improvement projects I'd like to complete, but I'm also reminded of how far we've come during that time.

#### My Job

I have a pretty incredible job and I'm thankful every day that my boss took a chance on me when she hired me, even if I didn't have the [background](http://mattfarrow.org/2017/04/19/my-research-journey/) to be a prospect researcher.
