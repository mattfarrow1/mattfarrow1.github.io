Scouting has faced its share of hurdles in addressing [social](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/us/boy-scouts-gay-leaders-feat/index.html) [issues](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/boy-scouts-reversing-century-old-stance-will-allow-transgender-boys.html) in recent years. Today, they announced that girls would be welcome in the Cub Scout program and a forthcoming Scouting program for older girls that allows them to attain the rank of Eagle Scout.

When I attended the World Jamboree in Chile in 1998, I was struck by how much of Scouting internationally is co-ed. As an Eagle Scout myself, I applaud the Boy Scout's decision in this matter and look forward to the opportunities that this affords young women in this country, my daughter included.
