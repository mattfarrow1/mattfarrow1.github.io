Wylie Overstreet and Alex Gorosh invited people around Los Angeles to look at the moon through a high-powered telescope. 

The awe and joy that you see on these people's faces brought a smile to my own face and reminds me of a quote from Edgar Mitchell, astronaut on Apollo 14:

> You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, â€˜Look at that, you son of a bitch.
