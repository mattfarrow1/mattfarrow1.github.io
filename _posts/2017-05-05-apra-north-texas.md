For those that don't know, I serve as the Vice President and Communications Director of [Apra North Texas](https://apranorthtexas.wildapricot.org/). When I started my role at the beginning of 2016, we had a sporadic presence on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/APRA_NT). I didn't want to be a chapter that only tweeted out event reminders and live-tweeted conferences, so I thought for a long time about what the account's voice would be.

What I settled on was using the chapter's Twitter account to regularly share news, information, and stories that would be interesting to others in the prospect development field. However, I also knew that there were many people who were on Twitter sporadically and many more who were not on it at all. To serve those people, I came up with the idea of posting a ["Week in Review"](https://apranorthtexas.wildapricot.org/Blog) on our chapter's [website](https://apranorthtexas.wildapricot.org/).

To collect content, I skim through approximately 30 different sites each week to try and find enough content to post between one and three times per day each weekday.

### Tools I Use

#### [Buffer](https://buffer.com)
I knew that I wanted the account to tweet regularly and there was no way I could spend my day sharing links to the world as I came across them. To solve that problem, I signed up for a free account with Buffer which lets me queue up to 10 links at a time to share. I can also set a posting schedule to define how many times per day and at what times I want content to go out. 

Using Buffer, I can usually get two to three days of content loaded up at once. The service has a web app, browser extension, and app so I can add posts wherever I am.

#### [Nuzzel](http://nuzzel.com/)

Nuzzel [(iTunes)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nuzzel-news-from-your-friends/id692285770?mt=8) is a really interesting service that connects to our Twitter account and surfaces links that the people I follow are sharing. For instance, I'll get a notification if three or more people share the same story, thus alerting me that this is something to look at adding to our feed as well.

#### [Linky](https://pragmaticcode.com/linky/)

Linky [(iTunes)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id438090426?&at=11lLye&ct=website) is a great little iOS app that lets you quickly and elegantly share content to Facebook and Twitter. If I don't want to Buffer something, Linky pre-populates a tweet for me with the article's title, link and suggested images.

#### [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/)

I write all of my content for this blog as well as Apra North Texas in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). MarkdownPad is a simple, lightweight Windows app that lets me write and preview Markdown. I'm also able to copy the text as HTML and paste it right into our site's CMS. 

#### [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/)

I'd be remiss if I didn't put a plug in for Tweetbot [(iTunes)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?ls=1&mt=8&at=11l4Hu) by Tapbots. I've used them for years and shudder at the thought of having to change Twitter clients.
