Jen Filla wrote a post yesterday titled "[Researcher, Are You Cheating Your Organization Out of Money?](http://www.jenniferfilla.com/researcher-are-you-cheating-your-organization-out-of-money/)" that really hit me, especially as we are working through wealth screening results at work.

> 1. Have you ever taken the gift capacity amount and reduced it because the prospect had never made large gifts to your organization?
2. Have you ever used a gift capacity rating calculator and lowered the result manually because you just couldnâ€™t believe the prospect could give that much money?
3. Have you ever calculated a gift capacity rating based only on assets you could get numbers for, even though the prospect was in a top wealthy list or had a lucrative occupation?

#3 in particular resonated with me. According to Jen, I might be suffering from what she refers to as "Concrete Moneyitis." Although the name is cute and clever, the condition is one that could be hindering our fundraising efforts and is therefore worthy of monitoring.

I was just looking at a prospect this morning who we'd previously rated at $100,00 to $249,999 but who had made $100,000+ gifts in each of the last three years. Was he underrated? It certainly seems so, but giving aside, the known assets indicated that was an appropriate rating. 

Unfortunately for me, there's not a [Z-Pak](https://www.drugs.com/mtm/zithromax-z-pak.html) equivalent for Concrete Moneyitis. I think this is a condition that I'm just going to have to overcome with hard work.
