One of the many hats I wear in [prospect research]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-03-29-research-pride.md %}) is that of genealogist, so when I saw this headline on The Washington Post, I was naturally intrigued:

#### [She saw anti-immigration politicians as hypocrites. So she launched ‘resistance genealogy.’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/she-saw-anti-immigration-politicians-as-hypocrites-so-she-launched-resistance-genealogy/2018/03/12/1926b528-1d77-11e8-b2d9-08e748f892c0_story.html)

The story is about Jennifer Mendelsohn, an amateur genealogist who has found herself using her skills exploring people's heritage to expose what she sees as the hypocrisy of what politicians are saying and their backgrounds.

> “Stephen Miller favors immigrants who speak English. The 1910 census shows his own great-grandmother couldn’t,” Mendelsohn wrote. She included a PDF of the census document, which specified that Miller’s grandmother spoke only Yiddish.

As I've written about [before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-04-02-gizmodo-comey-twitter.md %}), it is amazing what kinds of connections you can make using the data found online. I find Jennifer's personal form of protest to be incredibly creative.
