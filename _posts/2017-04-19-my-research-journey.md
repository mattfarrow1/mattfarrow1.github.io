When I was growing up, prospect research was not even a concept, much less a possible career path. Like many people, I backed into this career and rarely looked back. 

I fell in love with technical theatre [^1] as a freshman in high school. In the first weeks of school, I went to the man who would become my friend and mentor for the next several years and asked if I could help out with the fall musical. From that moment on, I spent most of my non-academic high school career backstage as a carpenter, electrician, and stage manager. Much to my parent's chagrin, I decided to pursue technical theatre as a college major.   

I went to [Ithaca College](http://www.ithaca.edu/hs/depts/theatre/) where I earned a B.F.A. Theatrical Production Arts degree with a technical concentration. I left there as a [technical director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_director) and electrician working primarily in educational institutions. It's hard to put into words the pride that I felt watching my students grow not only in their skill levels, but in their sense of accomplishment and increased confidence. 

During the last few years of my theatrical career, I had colleagues have their first children. I watched them leave the building at one o'clock in the morning after a tech rehearsal and come back seven or eight hours later, bleary-eyed and sleep deprived from taking care of their newborns in the interim. As much as I loved the theatre, I felt that as my wife and I started our family, I wanted to work in a job that let me come home at 5pm and didn't require me to work nights and weekends.

In 2010, we moved back to Dallas and I looked for ways to pivot my theatrical experience into a 9-5 job; I ended up working in special events for a small, community nonprofit. It was there that I learned that I enjoyed philanthropy, data, organization, and structure. What I didn't enjoy was front-line fundraising and volunteer management. 

I left that job and spent some time as a stay-at-home dad trying to figure out what I was going to do next. Harmonie knew my passion for structure, computers,  and organization[^2], and suggested looking at data management and prospect research positions. What I found is that while I felt I had the skills necessary to do the work, my resume didn't exactly scream ideal candidate. [^3]

In what I have to think of as a divine plan, I came to interview here at [Southern Methodist University](http://www.smu.edu/) and found out my future boss was a former [stage manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_management). She understood the training and experience I'd had and during my interview told me, "I can teach you how to do research. What I can't teach you is how to think." She understood what skills I could bring to the table and took a chance on hiring me.

The rest, as they say, is history. Today I can't imagine my life doing anything else. I [love this field](http://mattfarrow.org/2017-03-29-research-pride/) and I love helping my clients succeed in their work.

[^1]: I ascribe to the position that theatre is the craft or art form and theater is the venue.

[^2]: I even toyed with the idea of going into personal organizing.

[^3]: I'm not sure why. I mean, a former theatrical technician seems like a great fit on paper. :P
