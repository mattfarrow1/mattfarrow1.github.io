I've [mentioned before](http://mattfarrow.org/2017/07/25/where-i-keep-my-stuff/) that I use [1Password](https://1password.com) as my password manager of choice.  Last week, AgileBits, the product’s developer, [rolled out a proof of concept](https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/22/finding-pwned-passwords-with-1password/) to check and see if one of your passwords had been compromised by checking them against Troy Hunt's [Pwned Passwords](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/) site. 

If you are a 1Password member, you should check out the blog post to see how they’re accomplishing this in such a way that your password never has to leave your device to be checked against the database.
