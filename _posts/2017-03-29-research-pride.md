# Research Pride

As we celebrate [#ResearchPride](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23researchpride) month, I've been inspired to do something that I've wanted to do for ages - setup a blog - in order to share my love of this industry that has grown within me over the last four years.

I backed into the world of prospect development by way of the theatre[^1]. While those industries might seem worlds apart, I have found that both theatre and prospect development tend to be populated by people passionate about their work and more than willing to share their knowledge and expertise with you.

Earlier this year I was working on a project in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), trying to answer a question my boss's boss has asked me to look at. After two weeks of banging my head on the desk I was stumped. I decided to reach out to someone who was active on the [Prospect-dmm listserve](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/prospect-dmm), hoping that they might be able to offer some suggestions that I hadn't considered. I immediately got a response back saying they'd be happy to look at this issue and before lunchtime they'd sent me a script and a sample data file that functioned exactly as I'd needed.

They didn't need to take time out of their own work to do all of that work. I would have been thrilled to have a link to a [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) thread pointing me in the right direction. That same sense of community, of willingness to share knowledge, and respect for varying levels of experience have defined almost all of my interactions in this industry.  

I feel so blessed to be a part of this community and I look forward to getting to know more of you in the coming months and years.
