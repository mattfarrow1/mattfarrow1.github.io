I was reading an [article](https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/90228-christie-s-real-estate-chief-pinpoints-the-safest-markets-in-the-world) on Mansion Global for work recently (although I’ve been known to get lost in their listings before too!), and came across an interview with Dan Conn, the chief executive officer of Christie’s International Real Estate.

Mansion Global asked, “What does luxury mean to you?” and I thought Dan’s answer was incredibly thoughtful:

> If you just use it as an adjective, it’s massively overused and it doesn’t mean anything. But if you think of it as a noun, and you put it in a sentence, “I have the luxury of blank,” then you think about what people really want, what they care about, and how that’s different than anything else that’s out there.

I love the idea of luxury as a noun. Here are a few of the things that I have the luxury of:

- an incredible spouse and two wonderful children
- a stable job that challenges me along with a great boss
- health insurance
- financial stability
- a home
- caring and supportive extended family who live (or plan to live) close by
- a wonderful church family
- a close and supportive community of friends

It is so easy in this day and age to want more and more. When you sit down and think through what things you have the luxury of, it makes you realize how much you already have.
