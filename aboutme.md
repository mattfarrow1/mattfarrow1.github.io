### Hi, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a prospect researcher living in [Grapevine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapevine,_Texas), the [Christmas Capital of Texas](https://www.grapevinetexasusa.com/christmas-capital-of-texas/)!. I'm married to a [fundraising rockstar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harmonie-farrow-97a29310) (at least in my humble opinion) who conveniently happens to be my best friend, and we've been married for over a decade now. We're also the parents of two amazing kids.

Professionally, I'm the Vice President and Communications Director of [Apra North Texas](https://apranorthtexas.wildapricot.org) and I manage the chapter's [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/APRA_NT). We're a local chapter of [Apra International](http://www.aprahome.org/page/about-apra). 

### About This Site

I've thought about having my own site for a long time. I think that greatest appeal to me is feeling the freedom to write about whatever topic I'd like. I love Twitter, but I struggle to know whether the audience I'm speaking to is personal, professional, or something in the middle. I also love the idea of having a place where I own my own content and don't have to worry about a platform going away. 

So, you may see posts about prospect research and management, family, politics, R, and anything else that I find interesting. 

I have hosted my site through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) with a custom domain purchased through [Hover](https://www.hover.com). If you're looking for a place to get started, [here is the tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) I used to get started. The site's theme is forked from Dean Attali's [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).
