Apple recently released an ad for their new Homepod speaker featuring FKA twigs that appeared to me to be done practically, on-screen and not as a visual effect.

That thought was confirmed with this new video from Ad Week that offers a behind the scenes look at how the ad was filmed. I think for me, the film reminds me of a life I left behind almost a decade ago, a life working in the theatre as a carpenter and electrician.

I'd encourage you to watch the original film and then see the work that went into executing that vision on screen.
