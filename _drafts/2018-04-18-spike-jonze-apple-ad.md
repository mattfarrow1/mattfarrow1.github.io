Apple recently released an ad for their new HomePod speaker featuring FKA twigs that appeared to me to be done primarily practically, and not with visual effects. You can watch the ad here:

That thought was confirmed with [this new video](http://www.adweek.com/creativity/this-look-inside-spike-jonzes-apple-ad-is-as-fascinating-as-the-film-itself/) from Ad Week that offers a behind the scenes look at how the ad was filmed. For me, the film is a reminder of a part of my [life that I left behind]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-09-15-theatre-in-ithaca.md %}) almost a decade ago, a life working in the theatre as a carpenter and electrician.

I'd encourage you to watch the original film and then see the work that went into executing that vision on screen.
