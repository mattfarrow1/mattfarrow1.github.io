In addition to their regular bedtime stories, we try and read the Bible to our kids every night. Over the years, we've come up with quite a collection as our daughter has gotten older. Here are a few of the ones that have remained in regular circulation in our house.

### Babies

When our kids were born, we adopted a tradition from some friends of ours of saying a blessing over our children at night before they went to sleep.

> "The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make his face shine upon your and be gracious to you; the Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace." Numbers 6:24-26

### Toddlers

I have no idea why there are versions of this bible for boys and girls. Gender stereotypes aside, this is a really gentle introduction to the Bible for young children. Each page contains 3-4 short thoughts about the story, each followed by a simple action to help engage the child. For example:

> Long ago there was nothing in the world — no cars or dogs or ice cream. Everything was dark.
> *Close your eyes and see how dark it was.*

The page ends with a very simple prayer related to the story. A full-page illustration is on the facing page.

We received this Bible when our youngest was born from our Sunday School teachers at the time. We’re currently reading this version at night with our two-year old. Each story takes up a handful of pages, and I’d estimate that each page has about 40 words on it. The stories move quickly and each page has a full-color illustration to accompany it. 

### Kingergarten/First Grade

Two Christmas' ago, we were making up a list of Christmas gift ideas for our daughter. One idea was to get her a new Bible, and in the course of my research, I came across the  [Jesus Storybook Bible](https://www.sallylloyd-jones.com/books/jesus-storybook-bible/). This Bible is a little different from the others we'd had over the years. In addition to telling the stories of the Bible, each story shares a message showing how it points to God's ultimate plan, His great rescue.

> There are lots of stories in the Bible. But all the stories are telling one big story. The story of how God loves his children and comes to rescue them.

By the time we finished up the Jesus Storybook Bible with our daughter, I began to worry that hearing the same stories night after night might lead her to push back against the idea of hearing the Word each day. For years, Harmonie has read Jesus Calling, collection of 365 devotionals for the year. We recently discovered that their is an app version of the book and that discovery led us to find Jesus Calling for Kids. This devotional uses the same verses **(true?)** as the adult's version, but tells the devotional in such a way that kids can understand the message. We now end each day with our oldest reading the day's devotional before we say the blessing.

In a recent post on [Tools and Toys](http://toolsandtoys.net/the-ology-ancient-truths-ever-new/), Bradley Chambers shared a recommendation for a book called "[The Ology: Ancient Truths, Ever New](https://www.amazon.com/Ology-Ancient-Truths-Ever-New/dp/194257228X)." Bradley writes:

> I found this book through a friend of mine, and I’ve been blown away so far. It’s a great way to take kids deeper with scripture, but in a way they can understand. It was a great book to move onto from The Jesus Storybook Bible. Each chapter is broken down into bite size sections on a specific part of theology that is per

The fact that he recommends it as a follow-on to The Jesus Storybook Bible intrigues me and I look forward to picking up a copy to read with our kids.
