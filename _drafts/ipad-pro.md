Our home computer is a [Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) that's now five or six years old. It works ok, but over the last couple of years I have found myself using it less and less and my iPhone more and more for day-to-day work. I got an original iPad back when they came out in 2010 and an original iPad mini that my daughter used until it was accidentally dropped when she got out of the car one day. 

Since then I have waffled back and forth on whether I should embrace the iPad as my primary computer[^1]. I made a list of everything I did on the computer and worked through what I could and couldn't migrate over to an iPad. At the end of the day, the only thing that was holding me back was the desire to have a local copy (with [backups](http://backblaze.com)[^2]) of my media and photos.

Last fall I decided I wanted to move forward and get myself a new iPad Pro, but I decided I wanted to wait until the new models were released this year. We don't replace technology very often, so I wanted to have the newest model possible. Since my birthday and Christmas come near each other, I told my family that I wanted an Apple gift card that I could put towards a new iPad Pro, hopefully in March when they have come out in recent years. 

You may notice it is now June.

Apple decided to break with their recent release schedule and hold off on announcing the new iPads until [WWDC](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/june-2017/) last week. Fortunately for me, the new iPad Pros looked amazing, and even though I ended up waiting for eight months to purchase last year's birthday and Christmas presents, the wait was absolutely worth it. 

My new [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) arrived last week and the [10.5" iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) arrived last night.

### Keyboard

Outside of the Pencil, the only other accessory I wanted was a keyboard, preferably one that was integrated into the case and used Apple's Smart Connector for power. I'd hoped that Logitech would release a new version of their [Create](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/create-ipad-pro-keyboard) case that numerous people raved about. Instead, they released the [Logitech Slim Combo](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/slimcombo?crid=1221) keyboard which, ostensibly, did what I wanted. Unfortunately the case is bulky, the keyboard is floppy, the case doesn't close securely, and when it is closed there is a noticeable gap between the iPad and the keyboard. 

Needless to say, I'm disappointed with that product and will be returning it. I'm not sure what I'll end up going with, but given their prices, I want to make sure I get the right product for me.

### Media and Photo Management

I mentioned earlier my concerns around media and photo backup. What I've decided to go is continue to keep using my Mac as long as it will run to download movies, music, and TV shows that we purchase using iTunes. 

For photos, I've cancelled my Dropbox account and switched over to using iCloud Drive full-time. The added benefit is the ability to use iCloud Photo Library so now, whenever I take a photo, it is automatically downloaded to the photo library on the Mac. 

All of the documents, media, and photos then get backed up to Time Machine, a cloned drive that I keep in our safe deposit box, and of course to Backblaze. Yes, it's a little overkill, but I subscribe to the [3-2-1 backup strategy](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/) that I first learned about from a photographer years ago. The idea of losing all of out family's photos is terrifying to me and with this strategy I don't have to worry about the possibility.
