I've been lamenting for months now about the lack of posts here on the site. Sometimes that has been a result of not knowing what to talk about, but more often than not it is a result of having other priorities, especially around the holidays.

Coincidentally, I came across two other posts whose authors also lamented not doing more with their blogs, however each came to different conclusions.

Katie Floyd, [attorney](https://floydlaw.net/about/) and one of the hosts of the [Mac Power Users](https://www.relay.fm/mpu) podcast, [wrote a post](https://katiefloyd.com/blog/reevaluating-the-blog) explaining that blogging never really became something she enjoyed, as much as she tried.

> Many people I admire and respect have wonderful blogs and website, so I figured it was something that I should have too. Over the years I’ve tried to “force” myself to blog more often and it always felt like a chore.

Scott McNulty, who I was introduced to through [The Incomparable](https://www.theincomparable.com) podcast, has found himself recommitted to [writing more on his blog](http://blog.blankbaby.com/2018/01/i-miss-writing.html).

> Don't get me wrong, I still write a lot but the vast majority of my writing is for ye olde day job. I seem to have fallen out of the habit of writing for pleasure.

I can understand both Katie and Scott's positions with their respective blogs. When I first started this site, the idea of emulating those whose work I admire definitely played a role in my decision to start blogging. 

I have also enjoyed the technical challenge of teaching myself GitHub and Jekyll. I will, however, admit to having used those challenges as a crutch to not posting as often as I could, because I still haven't found a good workflow for posting from my iPad. Before the holidays I started brainstorming solutions and telling myself I'd get back to posting once those roadblocks were sorted out. After a couple of days I gave myself a mental head slap and realized there will always be something that I want to tweak or adjust. Here's to doing more in 2018.
