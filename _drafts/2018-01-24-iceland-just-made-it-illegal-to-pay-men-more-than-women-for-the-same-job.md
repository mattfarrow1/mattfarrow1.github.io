A few weeks I shared as article on the Apra North Texas Twitter feed regarding Iceland's new law making it illegal to pay different salaries based on gender. 

> Companies will have to undergo certification every three years to ensure that their pay policies follow the rules. Those that fail to prove pay parity will face fines.

My first reaction to this story was excitement that Iceland was helping lead the charge to close the [wage gap](http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/report-highlights/?doing_wp_cron=1515187873.9907569885253906250000) that exists in most of the world today.

My second reaction was depression that a country makes headlines for doing something that seems so fundamental to our humanity. There's nothing special about my Y chromosome that entitles me to more pay than a female.
