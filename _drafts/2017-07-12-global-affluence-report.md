At some point this year I started adding more prospect research blogs to my [RSS reader](https://feedbin.com/). I find RSS much quicker, especially for these sorts of feeds, to sort through and pick out interesting articles to [share]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-05-apra-north-texas.md %}).

One of the feeds I added was [Sotheby's Extraordinary Living](http://www.sothebysrealty.com/extraordinary-living-blog/) blog which offers an interesting (and fun!) look inside the world of some of our top prospects. Recently they published a report titled "Global Affluence: The Emerging Luxury Consumer."

>When it comes to purchasing a home, emerging luxury consumers are particularly interested in pursuing certain property lifestyles including waterfront, metropolitan and historic.  Discover trending locations for these popular property lifestyles, based on data compiled from sothebysrealty.com.

The entire report is only 14 pages and is very easy to digest. You have to create an account in order to download the report, but the blog is also sharing takeaways if you're not interested in signing up.
